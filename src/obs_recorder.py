"""Drive OBS Studio's recording from the capture orchestrator.

Why this exists
---------------
Video was the last stream still started and stopped by hand. That is why the
archive holds 364 minutes of footage containing 171 minutes of anything at all,
why several sessions have no video, and why several videos have no session: a
human decided when to press record, and a human decided what to call the file.

OBS Studio 28 and later ship ``obs-websocket`` v5 built in, so the orchestrator
can start and stop the recording on the same signal as every other stream, and
learn the output path from OBS itself instead of guessing which file in the
folder is newest.

The alignment problem, and why ``outputDuration`` solves it
-----------------------------------------------------------
A video file on its own cannot be placed on the game clock. The filesystem tells
you when the file was *written*, not when its first frame was *captured*, and
those differ by however long OBS took to finalise the container. Guessing that
offset is how gaze ends up drawn over the wrong moment.

``GetRecordStatus`` reports ``outputDuration``: how long the recording has been
running, in milliseconds. Read alongside the local clock, that gives frame zero
directly::

    t0 = now - outputDuration

Each sample is bracketed by a clock reading either side of the request, so the
round trip is measured rather than assumed, and the median of several samples is
taken. The result is written next to the video as ``<sid>_video.json``. With that
number, a frame at ``00:04:37`` in the file is at ``t0 + 277_000`` in wall-clock
time, and the gamestate stream converts that to a game time. Without it the video
is just a file.

Setup, once per machine
-----------------------
In OBS: Tools -> WebSocket Server Settings -> Enable. Copy the password and set
``PLAYSMART_OBS_PASSWORD``. Then ``poetry add obsws-python`` (needs Python 3.10,
which the Tobii wheels already pin us to).

Environment:
    PLAYSMART_OBS           "0" disables video entirely.
    PLAYSMART_OBS_HOST      default 127.0.0.1
    PLAYSMART_OBS_PORT      default 4455
    PLAYSMART_OBS_PASSWORD  from OBS's WebSocket settings.

Nothing here is allowed to take the capture down with it. OBS closed, websocket
off, wrong password, library missing - each prints a clear warning and returns
None, and the session records everything else. Video is worth having; it is not
worth losing gaze over.
