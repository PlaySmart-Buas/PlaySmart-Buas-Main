"""Read the League client's identity for the game being captured.

Added 2026-09 (iteration 5). Modified 2026-09-24: platform lookup falls back to the
chat identity and the client region. Modified 2026-09-25: ``client_context`` (game and
input settings, queue, tier) and ``end_of_game_stats`` (the post-game block, scrubbed).

The Live Client Data API (``liveclient_recorder.py``) says everything about the game
*in progress* except which game it is: there is no game id in its payload. Without
that id nothing links a capture session to its replay, its Match-V5 record, or to the
other four players' sessions of the same game. The League *client* (the lobby
process, "LCU") knows it, and keeps running while the game runs.

The LCU API is undocumented and unsupported by Riot, but tolerated and used by every
replay and overlay tool; it listens on a random port with a random password written
to a ``lockfile`` in the League install folder. Everything here is best-effort: a
missing client, a changed endpoint or a timeout returns an empty value and the
capture carries on. Only reads, never writes.

    python src/lcu.py            # print what the client reports right now
