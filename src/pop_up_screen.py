"""Label and upload one capture session.

Modified 2026-09 (iteration 5): rewritten - see below. Modified 2026-09-25: after the
recorders stop it also fetches the client's post-game stats block (``<sid>_eog.json``),
asks the player about their deaths (``self_labels.py`` -> ``<sid>_labels.json``), writes
a SHA-256 manifest of the session's files (``<sid>_manifest.json``) and appends one
line to ``data/sessions.csv``.

This used to be the weakest link in the pipeline. It asked the operator for a
player name and a game from a dropdown, then went looking for the newest
un-renamed file in each of data/gaze, data/input, data/emotion and data/eda and
assumed those belonged together. They frequently did not: if a recorder crashed,
the previous session's leftover file was the newest one and got adopted into
this session. The archive has a merged file whose gaze data is 2.6 hours from
the session named on it, and a machine holding eleven `merged_data_*.csv` with
identical checksums.

None of that guessing is needed any more. Every recorder now names its own file
`<session_id>_<stream>.csv` when it opens it, and `liveclient_recorder.py` writes
`<session_id>_meta.json` with the Riot ID, champion, game mode and map straight
from the game client. So this script just collects the files carrying this
session's id and uploads them.

The free-text game dropdown is gone with it — that field produced nine spellings
of two game names, including `valornat`, `valorant ` and `nogame`.
