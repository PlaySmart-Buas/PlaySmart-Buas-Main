"""Capture orchestrator: start the recorders when a League game starts, stop them when it ends.

Modified 2026-09 (iteration 5): rewritten - see below.

What changed and why
--------------------

**Capture now brackets the game, not the operator.** Before, F7 started the
recorders and F12 stopped them, so a session was however long someone remembered
to leave it running: the archive has a 74-minute recording containing one
27-minute game, and 364 minutes of video holding 171 minutes of anything at all.
League serves a local API at 127.0.0.1:2999 for exactly as long as a game is
running, so the game itself can define the boundaries.

**Stopping is now graceful, and that is not cosmetic.** This module used to call
``process.terminate()`` two seconds after F12. Three of the five recorders only
write their output at the end — gaze builds a list and writes in ``finally``,
EDA accumulates in memory, audio needs its ``SoundFile`` context manager to close
to finalise the WAV header. Terminating them truncated or destroyed that data
(the 44-byte "empty" WAVs in the old archive are exactly an unfinalised header).
With automatic stopping there is no F12 press at all, so the recorders are asked
to stop via ``session.request_stop()`` and then *waited for*; terminate is a last
resort after a timeout.

**Every stream shares one session id**, passed down the environment, so files are
named correctly when they are created instead of being paired afterwards by
guessing which file in each folder is newest.

Keys: F7 arms, F12 aborts. Same as before.

    python src/key_listener.py                 # normal capture
    python src/key_listener.py --dry-run       # no League, no hardware, stubs
    python src/key_listener.py --once          # one game then exit
